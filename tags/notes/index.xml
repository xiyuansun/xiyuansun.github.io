      <description>Part 1: Fundamental Techniques in Handling People
 “If you want to gather honey, don’t kick over the beehive&amp;rdquo; Criticism is futile because it puts a person on the defensive and usually makes him strive to justify himself. Criticism is dangerous, because it wounds a person’s precious pride, hurts his sense of importance, and arouses resentment. As much as we thirst for approval, we dread condemnation. The resentment that criticism engenders can demoralize employees, family members and friends, and still not correct the situation that has been condemned.</description>
